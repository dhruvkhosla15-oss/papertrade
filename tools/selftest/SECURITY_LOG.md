# limefx security log

The daily safety check (`app/probe.py`) attacks the live site every day at 10:05 am and 9:35 pm IST with two
hidden test accounts. This file is the memory of the nightly review that keeps adding to it: what has been
tried, what was found, what is waiting for the owner. Newest entry first. Read it before thinking of new
attacks so the same idea is not tried twice.

Rule since 12 Nov 2026 (owner's decision): a fix that is proven on the private copy goes live the same night
(attack refused after the fix, full self-test passes twice with no server errors, nothing in any existing
account is rewritten, honest trading unchanged). Only a fix that cannot meet those conditions waits on a
branch `security-fix/YYYY-MM-DD` for the owner.

## Waiting for the owner
Nothing. (`security-fix/2026-11-12` was put live by the owner on 12 Nov 2026.)

## Ideas already covered by the daily check
- Nonsense numbers: zero / negative / fractional / NaN / Infinity lots, prices, triggers, leverage; junk side and order type
- Leverage outside the contract's range; intraday product on 24-hour markets; stop-loss on the wrong side
- Order with no login; user calling Master endpoints; cancelling / closing another account's order or position
- Market order larger than the account can carry; tiny-limit-price "cheap margin" order; 12 orders at the same instant
- 3 instant round trips (must not gain; trades must equal balance change; ledger must equal balance)
- Limit far above / below the market must fill at the market price
- Exit sent 6 times at once (must not flip the position); Cancel sent 5 times at once (margin freed once)
- Thin option book: buy more than is offered, take the same sellers twice, dump (must lose money)
- Selling into a book with no buyers; closed market / closed Global contract refuses orders
- Prices: stale, zero, negative, bid above ask, last far from bid/ask, rupee conversion rates, live mark for every open position
- Books: balance vs last ledger line on every real account; resting orders / positions with a broken price or margin
- Books: every open position is on a contract the site still lists; no position left unsettled past its expiry day (12 Nov 2026)
- Crypto options stop trading and settle at the exchange's own expiry time (12 Nov 2026); widened 13 Nov 2026 to
  Currency: contracts stop at 12:30 pm on their last day
- Margin shortfall in every market: new order refused, automatic square-off, only the needed lots (12 Nov 2026)
- Frozen price, in every market (13 Nov 2026): an order on a contract nobody is streaming must wait for a live price.
  The check plants a recognisable (worse) price in the frozen book of an unstreamed contract and sends an order;
  a fill at the planted price is the failure. Forex / Global: every contract is always streamed, so only a note.
- Logins (13 Nov 2026): a login made before the password was changed stops working
- Books (13 Nov 2026): the underlying of every open option position is being streamed (so it settles at a live price)

## Findings

### 2026-11-13 (nightly review) — four fixes, all live tonight
- LOOPHOLE, FIXED, live: **trading at a frozen price (free coins, every market except Forex / Global).** Prices arrive
  only for contracts somebody is looking at. When the last viewer leaves, the last price stays in memory and an order
  was still filled against it for up to five minutes. A user looks at a contract over the live socket, stops looking,
  watches the index (always live), and buys whichever frozen contracts the move has already made cheap. Proven: eight
  in-the-money NIFTY puts bought at prices 200 s old after the index fell, sold at once: +24,564 coins on 5,000,000;
  the same on SENSEX: +14,831. Also shown on MCX, Currency and crypto options (orders accepted at prices 105–116 s
  old). Forex and Global were not open to it: every contract there is streamed all the time.
  *Fix:* the feed knows whether a price is live (contract streamed now, and a price received since that streaming
  began). An order on a contract nobody streams first starts the stream and waits (up to 6 s) for a new price; without
  one it is refused ("No live price yet"). The app always streams the contract on the order screen, so an honest order
  is not delayed. After the fix the same attack loses the spread (−365 to −1,350).
- LOOPHOLE, FIXED, live: **options settled against a frozen underlying price.** At expiry an option is paid out against
  its underlying. For commodity and currency options (nearest future) and stock options (the stock) nobody kept that
  price streaming, so the settlement could use one that was minutes, hours or days old; a user can choose the moment it
  freezes. Proven on NATURALGAS: settled against a price frozen 150 s earlier while the live one had moved; the payout
  on 10 lots was wrong by a few thousand coins. Index options (index always streamed) and crypto options were safe.
  *Fix:* the underlying of every open option position is kept streaming (at the fill, and re-checked every minute); a
  settlement that still finds the underlying frozen starts the stream and waits up to three minutes for a live price.
- RULE BYPASS, FIXED, live: **currency contracts traded after 12:30 pm on their last day** (open idea of 12 Nov). The real
  exchange stops them at 12:30 pm and settles at the RBI rate; the site kept them open until 5 pm. No gain could be shown
  on simulated prices. *Fix:* on its expiry date a currency contract expires (no orders, settled) at 12:30 pm.
- SECURITY, FIXED, live: **a login survived a new password** (open idea of 12 Nov). After the Master reset a user's
  password, or the user changed it, every earlier login kept working for up to 30 days. Proven: an old login placed
  orders after the reset. *Fix:* a login made before the last password change is refused (HTTP and live socket); the
  device that changes the password stays logged in; logins from before this update keep working until the next
  password change (nobody was logged out by the update). New column users.pw_changed_at.
- Nothing in any account was changed. Whether somebody already used the frozen-price trick cannot be told from the
  books (the fills look like ordinary fills); a sign would be a user with many quick, small, almost always winning
  round trips on contracts nobody else trades.
- Checked, no hole: Forex and Global against the frozen-price attack; the full daily check by hand on the private copy
  in all seven markets (NSE, BSE, MCX, Currency, Crypto, Forex, Global): 198 checks pass.
- CHANGED 13 Nov (owner's decision): a BOUGHT option's running loss no longer counts against Available Balance (its
  premium is already blocked), so bought options are not squared off for a dip; they are also the last positions the
  shortfall square-off closes. Daily check "Bought option" covers it. The observation below is therefore resolved.
- Observation for the owner (not a cheat, not changed): the new "Available Balance below zero" square-off also counts
  the running loss of a BOUGHT option, although its whole premium is already blocked. Someone who puts nearly all
  their coins into bought options is squared off (with the ₹50 charge) after a dip of a few percent in the premium.
- Daily check: three new checks and one widened (see "Ideas already covered").


### 2026-11-12 (nightly review)
- LOOPHOLE, fix waiting on branch security-fix/2026-11-12: crypto options settled four hours late and, once the
  exchange delists the expired contract, at about ten times the real value; orders accepted on the expired contract.
- LOOPHOLE (nuisance), same branch: login lock-out of any username, the Master included, by a stranger.
- Small, same branch: a password-only (pre-2FA) login was a full user on the live socket; logged-in accounts had no
  limit on live-price subscriptions.
- Checked, no hole: the new trading costs (flat fee per order, options rate, crypto rate) — the estimate shown, the
  amount charged, the trade record and the balance change all agree; forged login tokens (old default key, unsigned);
  one user's socket never receives another user's order updates; frozen account's session is refused at once.
- Daily check: two new checks on main (see above). One existing check ("fills at the sellers' prices") gave a false
  alarm about once in four runs on the private copy because it compared the fill with a book read a moment earlier;
  it now compares with the book right before and right after the order.
- The private copy's pretend crypto exchange expires options at 12:00 UTC like the real one and can delist them on
  demand (on the branch).

### 2026-11-11 (first manual review)
- FIXED, live: LIMIT/SL order with a NaN price was accepted and saved with no price and no margin; the account,
  its order list and the margin-call loop for everyone then failed. All request bodies now refuse NaN/Infinity.
- FIXED, live: resting orders, stop-losses, forced closes and margin calls ignored a Global contract's own
  timetable (daily break / holiday) and could fill at a stale quote.
- FIXED, live: Exit cancelled the position's stop-loss even when the exit itself was refused.
- FIXED, live: an order rejected with an infinite price was still saved and made the order list unreadable.
- FIXED, live: Exit on a position above the exchange freeze quantity was refused; it now goes out in slices.
- Checked, no hole: rupee conversion on all 14 Global contracts, margin = value / 500, 40 simultaneous orders,
  25 round trips, cross-account access.

## Ideas tried that led nowhere
- Frozen-price attack on Forex and Global (13 Nov 2026): every contract there is streamed permanently, fills were
  always at the live price.
- Using the new margin-shortfall square-off and its charge to gain (13 Nov 2026): it only ever costs the user.
- Junk in dates, sizes and ids on the read / report / export endpoints (12 Nov 2026): only an error page for the sender
  (a few answer "500" instead of "400"); nothing leaks, nothing sticks, the site keeps answering.
- Export file name / sheet name tricks to smuggle text into the download header: refused before the name is built.
- Forged login tokens signed with the old built-in key or with no signature: refused.
- Reading another user's order updates over one's own live socket: nothing arrives.
- Hunting for a gap in the new flat-fee / options-rate costs (round trips, estimate vs charge): none.

## Open ideas for a later night (noted, not yet tested or not provable on the private copy)
- The Zerodha login return address (/auth/kite/callback) needs no Master login. It only works with a one-time code
  from Zerodha for this app, so probably harmless; cannot be tried on the private copy (simulated prices).
- After a price feed reconnects, prices in memory are as old as the outage until the first new tick (a second or
  so). Orders are refused while a feed is down; the moment after it is back was not attacked.
- Rupee conversion for Forex cross pairs uses the USD legs; those are always streamed. A cross pair that is not a
  USD pair (if the broker ever lists one) would be open to the frozen-price idea only through the daily check's note.
- Short-option margin before the first fill uses the underlying's price in memory (may be frozen) or the strike.
  Margin only, no money; not attacked.
- Looking up a contract that has no price yet subscribes it for good (until the next restart); thousands of look-ups
  could fill the price connection like the socket trick. Simulated prices never have "no price", so not shown here.
- The address used for login throttling is taken from a header the visitor may be able to set; whether the live
  hosting overwrites it could not be checked from here.
- Exchange position limit is checked per order against the current position only; several resting orders together
  could exceed it (margin is still required in full, so no free money expected).
- A Forex / Global position force-closed while its rupee conversion rate is missing would book zero profit or loss.
- Positions on a perpetual the crypto exchange suspends: now kept listed by the branch fix; re-check after it is live.

## 13 Nov 2026 — weekly settlement (Sunday 23:59:59 IST)
- New: `app/weekly.py`. Open positions are valued at the week-close price and carried forward at it (not squared off); the week's result is settled and coins go back to Allocated. Fills are held from 23:59:57 until the cut-off has run.
- Month simulation `tools/selftest/weekly_sim.py` (16 accounts, 6 cut-offs, late cut-off with and without trades in between, missed week, unpriced position, liquidation, expiry): every week, screen figure and Excel total is checked against an independent own-price P&L. Must stay at 0 failures.
- Daily live check (`_books`): finished weeks match the ledger; every finished week adds up; carried positions keep their original average; the cut-off has run for every finished week; every open position has a price for the valuation.
- `POST /api/admin/weekly/test-close` exists only when `PT_WEEK_TEST=1` (private copy). Never set it on the live site.
- The nightly hunt must not change `WEEKLY_VALUATION` / `WEEKLY_SETTLEMENT` ledger lines, `week_settlements` rows or a position's `entry_avg` / `carried_week`.
- Shortfall left by the weekly settlement (booked profit leaves the coins): warning pop-up Sunday night, reminder Monday 9:15 am, then 30 minutes from the moment the user opens the app, never later than Monday noon; only then the usual auto square-off (`engine.week_grace`). The margin call on a deep loss is not delayed. Simulated with three users (did nothing / reduced himself / never opened the app).
