The daily safety check (`app/probe.py`) attacks the live site every day at 10:05 am IST with two hidden
test accounts. This file is the memory of the nightly review that keeps adding to it: what has been
tried, what was found, what is waiting for the owner's go-ahead. Newest entry first. Read it before
thinking of new attacks so the same idea is not tried twice.

## Waiting for the owner's go-ahead
(none)

## Ideas already covered by the daily check
- Nonsense numbers: zero / negative / fractional / NaN / Infinity lots, prices, triggers, leverage; junk side and order type
- Leverage outside the contract's range; intraday product on 24-hour markets; stop-loss on the wrong side
- Order with no login; trainee calling Master endpoints; cancelling / closing another account's order or position
- Market order larger than the account can carry; tiny-limit-price "cheap margin" order; 12 orders at the same instant
- 3 instant round trips (must not gain; trades must equal balance change; ledger must equal balance)
- Limit far above / below the market must fill at the market price
- Exit sent 6 times at once (must not flip the position); Cancel sent 5 times at once (margin freed once)
- Thin option book: buy more than is offered, take the same sellers twice, dump (must lose money)
- Selling into a book with no buyers; closed market / closed Global contract refuses orders
- Prices: stale, zero, negative, bid above ask, last far from bid/ask, rupee conversion rates, live mark for every open position
- Books: balance vs last ledger line on every real account; resting orders / positions with a broken price or margin

## Findings

### 2026-11-11 (first manual review)
- FIXED, live: LIMIT/SL order with a NaN price was accepted and saved with no price and no margin; the account,
  its order list and the margin-call loop for everyone then failed. All request bodies now refuse NaN/Infinity.
- FIXED, live: resting orders, stop-losses, forced closes and margin calls ignored a Global contract's own
  timetable (daily break / holiday) and could fill at a stale quote.
- FIXED, live: Exit cancelled the position's stop-loss even when the exit itself was refused.
- FIXED, live: an order rejected with an infinite price was still saved and made the order list unreadable.
- FIXED, live: Exit on a position above the exchange freeze quantity was refused; it now goes out in slices.
- Checked, no hole: rupee conversion on all 14 Global contracts, margin = value / 500, 40 simultaneous orders,
  25 round trips, cross-account access.

## Ideas tried that led nowhere
(none yet)
